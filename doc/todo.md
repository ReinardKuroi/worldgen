# TODO

## Basic ideas

- floating islands
- 3d
- props (trees houses rocks)
- the bottom part of the floating island
- maybe like cave entrances on the side
- spinning camera for preview

## Technical babble

- separate data generation from rendering
- come up with lightweight rendering system
- possibility to export object files
- separate functions for generation
- possibility to export heightmaps for future use

## Usefull stuff

- perlin2d for maps
- perlin3d for caves?
- triplanar mapping?

## Problems

How to efficiently represent vertex data and manipulate it? Look into python matrices.

There must be a way to better represent 3 meshes than a 2d array with floats.
